    [b]Settings:[/b] There are two settings that control the speed of moving from
    one tile to another and whether music plays upon solving. Please turn off the
    "Play Music on Solve" setting if streaming KTaNE on YouTube/Twitch/etc., as 5
    of the 7 songs in Canny Maze are copyrighted (the songs associated with images
    1 and 6 are not). [b]When in Twitch Plays, neither of these settings have any
    effect;[/b] the module moves instantaneously from one tile to the next, and it
    never plays music upon solving.


    [b]NOTE FOR UNCANNY MAZE:[/b] Because the images are disturbing, there is a setting
    in the module to blur all of the images past a given number (0 in order to blur
    all). Any number outside the ranges of 0-9 will leave all images unblurred.
