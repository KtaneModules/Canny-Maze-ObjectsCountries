  description: 'The thing that gets me about these modules is that the instructions
    are actually well-written, even though we only see images and text. We create
    the whole solution in our text-editing software, and it turns out correct.

    [b]NOTE:[/b] There are two settings that control the speed of moving from one
    tile to another and whether music plays upon solving. Please turn off the "Play
    Music on Solve" setting if streaming KTaNE on YouTube/Twitch/etc., as 5 of the
    7 songs are copyrighted (the songs associated with images 1 and 6 are not). [b]When
    in Twitch Plays, neither of these settings have any effect;[/b] the module moves
    instantaneously from one tile to the next, and it never plays music upon solving.
