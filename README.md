# Canny Maze

Current plan:

* Maze with the cannys 1-7
* Dimensions of the maze range from 5 to 8, randomly generated
* No wraparound, also no penalty for trying to go past the edge
* I need to make it distinct enough so that I can't just replace the cannys with numbers to get the exact same concept
