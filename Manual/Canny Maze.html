                <h2>On the Subject of Canny Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The thing that gets me about these modules is that the instructions are actually well-written, even though we only see images and text. We create the whole solution in our text-editing software, and it turns out correct.</p>
                <p>On this module will be an image of Mr. Incredible becoming canny alongside four arrows. These images, or "phases", are numbered 1-7, and are randomly distributed across a square grid with dimensions ranging from 5 to 8.</p>
                <p>Clicking on the center of the module reveals the entire maze, and clicking again returns to the current position. In the view of the whole maze, the starting position is surrounded by a blue border and the goal by a red border. Whichever phase is on the module at first is the type of maze present.</p>

                <h3>NOTES:</h3>
                <p>Modulo maze is (summing all orthogonal surrounding phases modulo current phase)+1 and moving to that one (modulo 7 if current phase is 1, backtracking allowed)<br>Binary maze is taking the binary of the phase number and inverting specific bits to get to the next phase<br>Digital maze is taking digital root of all surrounding phases and moving to that phase<br>Careful maze is only being able to move at certain times<br>Conditions maze is only moving in a direction if a condition is met<br>Walls maze is moving according to walls (visible on full maze layout so should be very rare)<br>Free maze is moving wherever whenever and should be extremely rare, perhaps appearing for a unicorn<br>Backtracking allowed wherever applicable</p>
